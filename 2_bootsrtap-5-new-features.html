<!-- NOTES -->
<!-- Bootstrap 5 has dropped jQuery! -->

<!-- Forms have been revamped -->

<!-- Right-To-Left (RTL) support added -->

<!-- New utility classes (positioning, font size, border radius, etc) -->

<!-- Minor changes to some components & grid (Jumbotron gone) -->

<!-- Bootstrap Icons -->

<!-- Two new components - Offacanvas & Accordion -->

<!-- The off canvas is a component that looks like a typical sidebar, it poops into the screen from the left or from the right but it can also come in from the top and from the bottom too; so this is a really good component for any extra navigation links or infoemation you want to show a user after they on a button or something  -->

<!-- The other new component the accordion looks something like this, so it's essentially a group of drop-down boxes which show and hide content when you toggle the titles; so this is nice for condensing a lot of information about several different things into a small space on the screen  -->

<!-- Bootstrap 5 also added extra color variables to it's color palette and you can see the whole grid of them right here and we can use these in our own sass files, when we are extending bootstrap -->

<!-- Bootstrap 5 also has a extensive section in the documentation about how to customize it, for example how to update the theme colors the utility values font sizes etc and we are going to be taking a look at how to customize bootstrap towards the end of this series -->
